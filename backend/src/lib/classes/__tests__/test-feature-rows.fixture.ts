// Test-only helper (#1524): builds the `ClassFeatureRowsCarrier` deriveResources'
// `featureRows` parameter expects, directly from the TS class/subclass
// definitions — the twelve lib/classes/<class>.ts modules stay the seed's
// AUTHORING input even though production now reads seeded rows instead
// (#1524's Fact 1). Lets every unit test that asserts on `.features` keep
// calling deriveResources with a bare class/subclass name (no DB round-trip)
// while still exercising the real read path (featuresFromRows). The DB-backed
// parity test (class-feature-parity.test.ts) is the proof this fixture and
// the seeded rows agree; if they ever diverge, that test — not this one —
// is what catches it.
//
// FIGHTER (#1227, #1528): `fighter.ts` carries no `.features` at all any more
// — its rows are literal seed data (prisma/seed/fighter-features.ts), which
// this src-side fixture can't import (backend/tsconfig.json's `rootDir:
// "src"` makes a src file importing anything under prisma/ a compile error,
// TS6059). `testFeatureRowsFor("fighter", ...)`'s classRows are therefore
// FIGHTER_BASE_ROWS below (a hardcoded mirror of fighter-features.ts's
// RESOURCE columns only — the TEXT stays empty, which is harmless for
// class-features-snapshot.test.ts: that suite records
// `withoutFeatures(deriveResources(...))`, stripping `.features` before
// snapshotting). class-feature-parity.test.ts is the suite that DOES assert
// on `.features` content, and it skips Fighter entirely for the same
// underlying reason (its own file's LITERAL_ROW_CLASSES check).
